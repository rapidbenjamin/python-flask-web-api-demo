### FIX ISSUES : 
# In development config mode(in config.py or dev-config.py file),
# the session files are not removed in session folder after the end of a user session (after browser closed or after 5 minutes time left)
    SESSION_TYPE = 'filesystem'
    SESSION_FILE_DIR =  'sessions'
    SESSION_FILE_THRESHOLD = 500
    SESSION_FILE_MODE = 600

    SESSION_PERMANENT = False
    # PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME = 5 -> ISSUE : if resized to 5, you'll get csrf_token missing issue
    PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME = timedelta(minutes=5)


### FIX ISSUES : 
# in config.py file,
# if PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME is set to a big value, you'll get a "csrf_token missing" issue
PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME = 5 -> ISSUE : if resized to 5


### ADD UNIT TESTS TO EACH MODULES ( users, auths, addresses, assets, etc.)
